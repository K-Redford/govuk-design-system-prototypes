# How to submit a new design pattern

Design patterns should be submitted in the following way:

- fork the [GOV.UK Design Patterns](#) repository on GitHub
- add a folder for your pattern in '/source/documentation/'
- create your pattern using one of the templates below
- commit your changes and raise a pull request

Pull requests will be reviewed every fortnight by the GOV.UK Design Patterns team.


## Design pattern templates

We've defined 4 states that a design pattern can be in and created templates for each one.
Patterns must pass through all 4 states.

Choose the most appropriate template for the pattern you want to create.


### 1. Backlog

You've identified the pattern as one that we don't have and need, but you haven't started work on it yet.

### 2. Alpha

You've started working on the pattern but it's not complete and has not been thoroughly tested yet.

### 3. Beta

on feedback from service teams.
