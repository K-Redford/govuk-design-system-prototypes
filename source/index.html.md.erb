## [008 - Round 2 research](/v8/service-toolkit)
- removed previous and next links as they did not test well
- changed description of Design Patterns in Service Toolkit, so content designers know it's for them as well
- change call-to-action on Design Patterns landing page to make it clearer what it does
- changed 'Contribution guidelines' to 'Submit a pattern' to make it more task focussed
- removed seperate departmental libraries for now
- reordered left nav so patterns are at top
- refactor nav so we can add meta data (like status) against each pattern
- automatically sort pages alphabetically in the nav
