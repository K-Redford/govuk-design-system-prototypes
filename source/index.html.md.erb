# GOV.UK design resources prototypes

These prototypes explore options for publishing design resources on GOV.UK. [The source code is available on GitHub](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_design_prototypes)

## [Research round 4](https://govuk-design-system-prototypes.cloudapps.digital/v9/govuk_service_toolkit)

In this version we:

- Updated the styling of the navigation so users have a better understanding of hierarchy
- changed styling of status tag (was confused with phase banner for Design patterns in research)

---


## [Research round 3](https://govuk-design-system-prototypes-round-3.cloudapps.digital/v9/govuk_service_toolkit/)

In this version we:

- refactored the code so we can generate pages and navigation using YAML frontmatter
- added lots of missing patterns from the master list
- added aliases for patterns (for when we implement auto-suggest)
- added a prioritised backlog page
- added a departmental patterns page
- added an patterns statistics page
- removed the anchored heading icon (it confused one user and is less relevant for multi-page docs)
- added the ability to style left nav items according to pattern status
- Embedded the Hackpads in the pattern pages
- Added 'Guide', 'Code' and 'Discussion' tabs to the top of each pattern
- added pattern status to items in navigation
- changed pattern status styling on pattern page
- added more placeholder content for backlog patterns
- updated typography to use “elements” sizing / spacing
- added a 'theme' meta-data item and group patterns in each nav section by theme
- added GOV.UK Frontend documentation
- added "last edited date"
- added link to community page from status tag

## [Research round 2](https://govuk-design-system-prototypes-round-2.cloudapps.digital/v8/govuk_service_toolkit/)

In this version we:

- redesigned the Design Patterns landing page to make it consistent with other GDS product pages
- added primary nav to the Design Patterns header to make it more consistent with other GDS product pages
- moved the search from the Design Patterns header into the left nav of the Patterns section
- made it so users now jump straight into the first pattern (reckon: seeing a pattern is the best way to understand what they are)
- tweaked the colour pattern, as it's now the first one users see
- removed previous and next links from pattern pages
- updated Service Toolkit and Design Patterns landing page copy to use more keywords
- reorganised the Service Toolkit page around activities
- added a 'contact the team' call to action
- made patterns order alphabetically within each category
- changed the way nav works so we can add meta data (like status) against each pattern
- updated the GOV.UK Frontend product page to make it consistent with other product pages
- added a product page for the GOV.UK Prototype Kit
- removed seperate departmental libraries for now
- added links back to the Service Toolkit from each product page
- added status and meta data

## [Research round 1](https://govuk-design-system-prototypes-round-1.cloudapps.digital/)

In this version we:

- explored different ways of organising departmental patterns in relation to 'global' patterns
- explored the idea of a single 'design system' product
- explored a single-page version of the patterns in the Service Manual that used the tech doc format
