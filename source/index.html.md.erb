## [Version 9](/v9/govuk_service_toolkit)

This version is for research round 3.

In this version we:

- refactored the code so we can generate pages and navigation using YAML frontmatter
- added lots of missing patterns from the master list
- added aliases for patterns (for when we implement auto-suggest)
- added a prioritised backlog page
- added a departmental patterns page
- added an patterns statistics page
- removed the anchored heading icon (it confused one user and is less relevant for multi-page docs)
- added the ability to style left nav items according to pattern status
- Embedded the Hackpads in the pattern pages
- added pattern status to items in navigation
- changed pattern status styling on pattern page
- added more placeholder content for backlog patterns
- updated typography to use “elements” sizing / spacing
- added a 'theme' meta-data item and group patterns in each nav section by theme
- added GOV.UK Frontend documentation

## [Version 8](/v8/govuk_service_toolkit)

This version is for research round 2.

In this version we:

- redesigned the Design Patterns landing page to make it consistent with other GDS product pages
- added primary nav to the Design Patterns header to make it more consistent with other GDS product pages
- moved the search from the Design Patterns header into the left nav of the Patterns section
- made it so users now jump straight into the first pattern (reckon: seeing a pattern is the best way to understand what they are)
- tweaked the colour pattern, as it's now the first one users see
- removed previous and next links from pattern pages
- updated Service Toolkit and Design Patterns landing page copy to use more keywords
- reorganised the Service Toolkit page around activities
- added a 'contact the team' call to action
- made patterns order alphabetically within each category
- changed the way nav works so we can add meta data (like status) against each pattern
- updated the GOV.UK Frontend product page to make it consistent with other product pages
- added a product page for the GOV.UK Prototype Kit
- removed seperate departmental libraries for now
- added links back to the Service Toolkit from each product page
- added status and meta data
