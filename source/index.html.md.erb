## [Version 8](/v8/service-toolkit)

This version is for research round 2.

In this version we:

- redesigned the Design Patterns landing page to make it consistent with other GDS product pages
- added primary nav to the header to make it more consistent with other GDS product pages
- moved the search from the header into the left nav of the Patterns section
- removed previous and next links from pattern pages
- updated Service Toolkit and Design Patterns landing page copy to use more keywords
- added a 'contact the team' call to action
- made patterns order alphabetically within each category
- changed the way nav works so we can add meta data (like status) against each pattern
- removed seperate departmental libraries for now
