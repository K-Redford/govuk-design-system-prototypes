## [Version 8](/v8/service-toolkit)

This version is for research round 2.

In this version we:

- removed previous and next links as they did not test well
- changed the description of Design Patterns in the Service Toolkit, so content designers know it's for them as well
- redesigned the Design Patterns landing page so that it better explains the benefits and main features
- changed 'Contribution guidelines' to 'Submit a pattern' to make it more task focussed
- removed seperate departmental libraries for now
- reordered the left nav sections slightly
- changed the way nav works so we can add meta data (like status) against each pattern
- automatically sorted pages alphabetically in the nav
