Find out how to [protect your service against fraud](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/protecting-your-service-against-fraud#avoid-using-national-insurance-numbers-to-verify-identity) if you currently use National Insurance numbers to verify identity.

##How it works 

Use a single text field labelled ‘National Insurance number’. Write it out in full and don’t use abbreviations such as ‘NINO’ or ‘NI Number’.

You should:

- allow for 13 characters as National Insurance numbers are spaced in pairs followed by a single letter
- allow upper and lower case letters and strip out spaces before validating
- avoid using ‘AB 12 34 56 C’ as an example - it belongs to a real person - use ‘QQ 12 34 56 C’ instead
