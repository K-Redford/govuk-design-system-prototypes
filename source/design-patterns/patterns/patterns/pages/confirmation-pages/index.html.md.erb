Let users know they’ve completed a transaction.

##When to use this pattern

You should use a confirmation page at the end of a transaction to reassure users that they have completed it and to help them understand what to expect next.

##How it works
Your confirmation page must include:

- a reference number, if there is one
- details of what happens next and when
- contact details for the service
- links to information or services that users are likely to need next
- a link to your feedback page
- a way for users to save a record of the transaction, for example, as a PDF

###Help users who bookmark the page

Some users will bookmark the confirmation page as a form of receipt. You should allow them to return to the page, whenever possible.

If you can’t, make sure your service responds in a helpful way when users return using a bookmarked link. For example, if people use your service to make an application you could provide links to information on:

- tracking an application
- starting a new application
- what to do (or who to contact) if you have a problem with your application
