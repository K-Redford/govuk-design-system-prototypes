  <p>This guide explains how to structure question pages.</p>


<h2 id="example-of-a-question-page">Example of a question page</h2>

<p><img src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/595504e2ed915d0baf0000a6/What_is_your_date_of_birth.png" alt="What is your date of birth.png"></p>

<h2 id="get-the-code">Get the code</h2>

<p>You can get the code and assets you need for question pages in <a rel="external" href="http://govuk-elements.herokuapp.com/form-elements/">GOV.UK elements</a>.</p>

<h2 id="setting-up-a-question-page">Setting up a question page</h2>

<p>Question pages should include a:</p>

<ul>
  <li>back link</li>
  <li>page heading</li>
  <li>continue button</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="back-link">Back link</h2>

<p>Always include a back link on question pages.</p>

<p>Some users don’t trust browser ‘back’ buttons when they’re entering data. Adding a ‘back’ link reassures them that it’s possible to go back and change previous answers.</p>

<p>This should be at the top of the page because users are most likely to want to go back when they first land on a page. Make sure it takes them to the previous page and that it works when JavaScript isn’t available.</p>

<h2 id="page-headings">Page headings</h2>

<p>You can use a statement or question format for page headings. Once you’ve chosen a format, try to use it consistently across all your question pages (unless you have a good reason not to).</p>

<h3 id="using-a-question-as-the-page-heading">Using a question as the page heading</h3>

<p>If you’re only asking for one piece of information on a page, use a question as the page heading - for example, ‘What is your home postcode?’.</p>

<p><img src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5955026b40f0b60a40000098/What_is_your_home_post_code.png" alt="What is your home post code.png"></p>

<h3 id="using-a-statement-as-the-page-heading">Using a statement as the page heading</h3>

<p>If you need to group related questions on a single page, use a statement as the heading.</p>

<p>This example uses ‘Passport details’ to describe the related questions:</p>

<p><img src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5955032940f0b60a440000b8/Passport_details.png" alt="Passport details.png"></p>

<h2 id="section-headings">Section headings</h2>

<p>Avoid duplicating the same page heading across multiple pages.</p>

<p>The page heading should relate specifically to the information being asked for on the current page, not any higher-level section the page is part of.</p>

<p>If you need to show the high-level section, you can use the ‘secondary-heading’ style - for example, ‘About you’.</p>

<p><img src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/595505f9e5274a0a690000b3/What_is_your_home_address.png" alt="What is your home address.png"></p>

<h2 id="continue-button">Continue button</h2>

<p>Make sure your ‘Continue’ button is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>labelled ‘Continue’, not ‘Next’</li>
  <li>aligned to the left so users don’t miss it</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="asking-users-questions">Asking users questions</h2>

<p>When asking questions, you should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>explain why they’ll be asked questions</li>
  <li>say how many questions users might need to answer</li>
  <li>order questions to give most users the quickest result</li>
  <li>only ask questions that users will be able to answer</li>
  <li>avoid asking for information that you can find in government data</li>
  <li>allow users to answer ‘I don’t know’ or ‘I’m not sure’ - if these are valid responses</li>
  <li>translate supporting documents into clear questions on the page - don’t force users to go away and read background information before they can give an answer</li>
</ul>
