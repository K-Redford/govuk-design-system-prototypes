## Example

![](Dates_1.png)

Use 3 fields as it’ll be easier for you to validate each part rather than trying to review a single field.

Don’t automatically tab users between fields because this can clash with normal keyboard controls and confuse people.

Calendar controls aren’t particularly useful for known dates and some users struggle with select boxes.


## Asking for dates from documents and cards

If you ask for a date exactly as it’s shown on a passport, credit card or similar item, make the fields match the format of the original. This will make it easier for users to copy it across accurately.
