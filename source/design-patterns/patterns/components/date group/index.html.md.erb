## Example

![](Dates_1.png)

Use 3 fields as it’ll be easier for you to validate each part rather than trying to review a single field.

Don’t automatically tab users between fields because this can clash with normal keyboard controls and confuse people.

Calendar controls aren’t particularly useful for known dates and some users struggle with select boxes.


### Triggering the iPhone numeric keyboard

To trigger the numeric keyboard on iPhones, add a pattern attribute to the input element like this: ````pattern="[0-9]*"````


## Asking for dates from documents and cards

If you ask for a date exactly as it’s shown on a passport, credit card or similar item, make the fields match the format of the original. This will make it easier for users to copy it across accurately.


## Asking for approximate dates

If you don’t need an exact date and you’re asking for one that users might struggle to remember (for example ‘the date you lost your passport’), make sure you allow them to enter an approximate date, like ‘June 1983’.
