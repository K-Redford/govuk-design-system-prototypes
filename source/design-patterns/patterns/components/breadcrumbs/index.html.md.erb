##Overview

Help users orientate themselves and navigate pages within a hierarchical structure.

<div class="example">
	<div class="govuk-c-breadcrumb">
	  <ol class="govuk-c-breadcrumb__list">
	    <li class="govuk-c-breadcrumb__list-item">
	      <a class="govuk-c-breadcrumb__link" href="/section">Section 1</a>
	    </li>
	    <li class="govuk-c-breadcrumb__list-item">
	      <a class="govuk-c-breadcrumb__link" href="/section/sub-section">Sub-section</a>
	    </li>
	  </ol>
	</div>
</div>

## When to use this component

Breadcrumbs are a form of navigation that convey the hierarchical relationship between pages.

They are also used for orientation. If a user lands on any page they should be able to understand where they currently are in the hierarchy of a website.

### When not to use this component

Breadcrumbs are not appropriate for use in a flat website structure, or to convey progress through a linear journey or transaction. We recommend using [back button](/design-patterns/patterns/components/back_button/) for this.

Their use should also be considered against other navigational devices on the page. Breadcrumbs are not always necessary where there is permanently visible navigation, such as a sidebar.

## How it works

### Standard example

Your breadcrumb should include the user’s current page, however it should be visually different from the other links within the breadcrumb.
<% partial "/layouts/example-no-code" do %><div class="govuk-c-breadcrumb">
  <ol class="govuk-c-breadcrumb__list">
    <li class="govuk-c-breadcrumb__list-item">
      <a class="govuk-c-breadcrumb__link" href="/section">Section 1</a>
    </li>
    <li class="govuk-c-breadcrumb__list-item">
      <a class="govuk-c-breadcrumb__link" href="/section/sub-section">Sub-section</a>
    </li>
  </ol></div><% end %><ul class="tabs">
	<li><a href="#html">HTML</a></li>
	<li><a href="#nunjucks">Nunjucks</a></li>
	<li><a href="#readme">Read me</a></li>
</ul>
<a class="tab_drawer_heading" href="#html">HTML</a>
<div class="tab-content" id="html">
<% partial "/layouts/example-only-code" do %>
<div class="govuk-c-breadcrumb">
  <ol class="govuk-c-breadcrumb\_\_list">
    <li class="govuk-c-breadcrumb\_\_list-item">
      <a class="govuk-c-breadcrumb\_\_link" href="/section">Section 1</a>
    </li>
    <li class="govuk-c-breadcrumb\_\_list-item">
      <a class="govuk-c-breadcrumb\_\_link" href="/section/sub-section">Sub-section</a>
    </li>
  </ol>
</div><% end %></div>
<a class="tab_drawer_heading" href="#nunjucks">Nunjucks</a>
<div class="tab-content readme" id="nunjucks">

# Breadcrumb

## Introduction

A breadcrumb is a GOV.UK element that helps users to understand where they are within the site and move between levels.

## Guidance

More information about when to use breadcrumb can be found on [GOV.UK Design System](http://www.linktodesignsystem.com/breadcrumb "Link to read guidance on the use of breadcrumb on Gov.uk Design system website")

## Dependencies

To consume the breadcrumb component you must be running npm version 5 or above.

Please note, this component depends on @govuk-frontend/globals and @govuk-frontend/icons, which will automatically be installed with the package.

## Installation

    npm install --save @govuk-frontend/breadcrumb

## Requirements

### Build tool configuration

When compiling the Sass files you'll need to define includePaths to reference the node_modules directory. Below is a sample configuration using gulp

    .pipe(sass({
        includePaths: 'node_modules/'
    }))

### Static asset path configuration

To show the button image you need to configure your app to show these assets. Below is a sample configuration using Express js:

    app.use('/public', express.static(path.join(__dirname, '/node_modules/@govuk-frontend/icons')))

## Component arguments

If you are using Nunjucks,then macros take the following arguments

<div>

<table class="govuk-c-table">

<thead class="govuk-c-table__head">

<tr class="govuk-c-table__row">

<th class="govuk-c-table__header" scope="col">Name</th>

<th class="govuk-c-table__header" scope="col">Type</th>

<th class="govuk-c-table__header" scope="col">Required</th>

<th class="govuk-c-table__header" scope="col">Description</th>

</tr>

</thead>

<tbody class="govuk-c-table__body">

<tr class="govuk-c-table__row">

<td class="govuk-c-table__cell ">string</td>

<td class="govuk-c-table__cell ">No</td>

<td class="govuk-c-table__cell ">string</td>

<td class="govuk-c-table__cell ">Yes</td>

<td class="govuk-c-table__cell ">Title of the breadcrumb item</td>

</tr>

<tr class="govuk-c-table__row">

<th class="govuk-c-table__header" scope="row">url</th>

<td class="govuk-c-table__cell ">string</td>

<td class="govuk-c-table__cell ">No</td>

<td class="govuk-c-table__cell ">Url of the breadcrumb item</td>

</tr>

</tbody>

</table>

</div>

</div>

### Mobile varient example

<div class="panel panel-border-wide panel-experimental">
<h3><span class="experimental">Experimental</span></h3>
<p>This mobile varient is experimental. It is currently in use within an A/B test on GOV.UK. Feel free to use it in your service and <%= link_to 'let us know what you find', issues_link(current_page.data.title) %></p>
</div>

When displayed on a small screen device the visual relationship between pages in the breadcrumb are lost due to content wrapping over multiple lines. It also pushes the main content further down the page.

This component has a CSS modifier `breadcrumbs--collapse` which collapses the breadcrumb into a single link, similar to the [back button](/design-patterns/patterns/components/back_button/).

This reveals the parent of the current page so the user can travel up through the hierarchy of the site or section one level at a time.




<% partial "/layouts/example" do %>
<div class="breadcrumbs breadcrumbs--collapse">
  <ol>

    <li>
        <a aria-current="false" href="/">Home</a>
    </li>

    <li>
        <a aria-current="false" href="#">Level one</a>
    </li>

    <li class="breadcrumbs__parent">
        <a aria-current="false" href="#">Level two</a>
    </li>

    <li class="breadcrumbs__current-page">
        <a aria-current="page" href="#content">Level three</a>
    </li>
  </ol></div><% end %>


### Navigation markup

If the breadcrumb is the only form of navigation on the page then it should be marked up using `<nav>` in place of a `<div>`. This is to limit confusion screen reader users may face with multiple navigational components on the page.


##Research on this component

Many iterations of this component have been tested across Gov.uk. Some observations from research are

- People do use breadcrumbs to navigate and have a strong mental model of how breadcrumbs work (they show how content is organised)
- There isn’t a common way they are used for orientation
- People used them to “go home” when they feel too deep in the website
- Some users understood that they represent hierarchy of the content, however some users expect breadcrumbs to show the path they have personally taken to reach that specific piece of content
- People used them to go back one step, hence often compared to a back button - allowing to navigate in a smaller section of the website
 - When the breadcrumbs were tested without the “Current page” users were observed jumping back two levels
- Some people didn’t interact with them because they didn’t notice them and generally prefer to use the browser back button
