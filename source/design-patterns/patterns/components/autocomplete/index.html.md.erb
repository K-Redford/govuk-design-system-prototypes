## Overview

![Animation of the autocomplete being used](autocomplete.gif)

**This is an [alpha pattern](/design-patterns/patterns/overview/pattern_status/#alpha)
that’s being researched by the GDS design team and is likely to change.**

You can try a [demo of the autocomplete component][demo] and [share your
feedback on Hackpad](#hackpad).

## Research on this pattern

Read a blog post about the [research on this pattern](https://docs.google.com/a/digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/document/d/1OdLa3rioziYkB7f5QPFkRp-Fg2m-Vphq09BNeumq8Hc/edit?usp=sharing).

### Next steps

More research is required to find out:

- how it works in scenarios other than picking a country
- what metadata is useful to show to users (for example, categorisation of things)
- how results should be ordered
- how comfortable users are with changing previous answers
- whether users are comfortable providing an answer that isn’t in the list
- whether it would be helpful to show the list when users first focus it
