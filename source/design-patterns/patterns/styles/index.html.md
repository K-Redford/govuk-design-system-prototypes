The core styles that will make your service look and feel like GOV.UK.

Providing you are using the <a href="">GOV.UK Prototype Kit</a> or have <a href="">GOV.UK Frontend</a> included in your build, the code supplied in the design system should not need any additional styling.

Should you need to apply styles manually you should follow existing GOV.UK conventions. For example, don’t assign new meanings to colours, don't change the styling of buttons or change the thickness of borders on form inputs.


##Services on GOV.UK

If you are creating a service that will be hosted on a <strong>service.gov.uk</strong> domain it must use these styles. This includes the use of the “New Transport” webfont and appropriate <a href="#">patterns</a> and <a href="#">components</a>.




##If your service is on a different GOV.UK domain
If your website is on a gov.uk sub-domain, such as <strong>localcouncil.gov.uk</strong> you are not permitted to use the “New Transport” webfont and are not required to use any GOV.UK styles.

##If your service isn’t on GOV.UK
You are not permitted to use the “New Transport” webfont or any GOV.UK styles.

In both of these use cases the code and guidance found in <a href="#">patterns</a> and <a href="#">components</a> should be considered best practice, with the appropriate adjustments made to fit with the style of your organisation.
